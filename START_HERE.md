## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

### Required Accounts (Free)
- [ ] **GitHub** - [github.com](https://github.com)

- [ ] **Vercel** - [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) ← Frontend hosting

### Required Credentials
- [ ] **MongoDB Atlas** connection string (you already have this)
- [ ] **Gmail App Password** (takes 2 minutes to generate)
- [ ] **Strong JWT Secrets** (we'll generate these)

### Optional
- [ ] **Redis Cloud** connection string (optional, for caching)

## 🎯 The 4-Step Deployment Process

```
Step 1: Push to GitHub (2 min)
   ↓
Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 min)
   ↓
Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (5 min)
   ↓
Step 4: Update CORS & Test (3 min)
   ↓
🎉 Your app is LIVE!
```

---

## 🔑 Quick Setup - Critical Info

### 1. Generate JWT Secrets (30 seconds)

Open terminal/PowerShell and run this **twice**:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy both outputs - you'll need them for Railway environment variables.

### 2. Get Gmail App Password (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** (if not already)
3. Click **App Passwords**
4. Select: **Mail** → **Other (Custom name)** → "Inventory System"
5. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)

### 3. Get MongoDB Connection String

You already have this! It looks like:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
```

### Vercel (Frontend)
1. Detects Vite/React application
2. Builds production bundle (`npm run build`)
3. Deploys to global CDN
4. Provides a URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`

3. **Test locally first** - Make sure everything works
4. **Monitor logs** - Check Railway and Vercel dashboards
5. **Set up backups** - Enable MongoDB Atlas backups
