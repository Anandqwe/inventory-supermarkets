## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Issue: Access Denied shows for Admin
**Fix:**
1. Open browser console
2. Run: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Refresh page
4. Login again

### Issue: Buttons visible for Viewer
**Cause**: Page not using PermissionGuard components yet
**Fix**: Wrap buttons with PermissionGuard (see guide)

### Issue: Can access restricted URL
**Cause**: Route not protected in App.jsx
**Fix**: Already done for all routes! Re-check implementation.

### Issue: Console errors
**Check:**
1. Import paths correct?
2. PERMISSIONS constant imported?
3. Component syntax correct?
