## 🔥 Dealing with Cold Starts

### What Are Cold Starts?

When your app is inactive for 15 minutes on Render's free tier:
1. Server spins down to save resources
2. Next request wakes it up (takes ~30 seconds)
3. Subsequent requests are fast

### Solutions

#### Option 1: Keep It Warm (Free)

Use a cron job service to ping your API every 14 minutes:

**Recommended Services:**
1. **[cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)** - Free, reliable
2. **[UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com)** - Free, 5-min intervals
3. **[Freshping](https://freshping.io)** - Free, monitoring included

**Setup (2 minutes):**
```
1. Sign up for cron-job.org
2. Create new cron job
3. URL: https://your-app.onrender.com/health
4. Interval: Every 14 minutes
5. Save and enable
```

#### Option 2: Upgrade to Paid ($7/month)

Benefits:
- ✅ No cold starts
- ✅ Always-on service
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ More resources

#### Option 3: Accept Cold Starts

Good for:
- Development/testing
- Demo applications
- Low-traffic apps
- Budget projects
