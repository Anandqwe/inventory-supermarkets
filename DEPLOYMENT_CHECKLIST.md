| Backend won't start | Check Railway logs, verify MongoDB URI |
| Frontend blank page | Check browser console, verify API URL |
| CORS errors | Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway |
| Can't login | Seed database, check credentials |
| 500 errors | Check Railway logs for details |
| Slow loading | Check MongoDB/Redis connection |
